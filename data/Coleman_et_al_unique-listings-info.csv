There are no refunds on shipping charges.  When purchasing this item you are agreeing to the following:  NO CLAIMS FOR SMALL BROKEN PARTS such as antennae, detached tails, leg, head, wing or broken tarsi.   This sometimes happens in shipping and are an easy fix.  With  skeletons such as birds, a head or legs can easily be detached and bats it can be a foot or a head.  When it comes to bugs, it is usually the beetle heads, especially horned beetles and Mantis are usually legs or head. These small parts are easily fixable and you should be aware that you may have to fix (glue) a part or two when purchasing items like this and we will direct you through it.  We do offer videos that show you exactly how to repair these items as well.

 Framed Display Approx. Dimensions: 7 x 7 3/4 x 1 1/2"" 
 
 
 This is nicely showcased in a shadowbox type frame that suspends him in a clear elasticity film so both sides may be viewed unobstructed and also gives the specimen the  illusion of ""floating""!    This can be opened but I advise against it as the specimens or the elasticity strip usually are damaged when you open the display.  If the film in your display starts to stick together or gets some bubbles in it you can open the case very slowly so the film releases from both side and close again very slowly and the problem should be resolved.  If the film gets touched or is in a hot area this can happen but it is a very easy fix also s ometimes in shipping the specimen can shift a little in the display.  If this happens please contact us and we will direct you on a quick and easy fix.     Once the display has been opened returns are no longer accepted.  
 
 
 HANGING DISPLAYS:  The floating displays all have removable bases so if you would like,  just a piece or two of Velcro or command strip will mount these right to your wall without a problem.  The case will keep him clean and safe for years to come!

the wings (or as perfect as you could expect from wild caught specimens),
with exception of some leg damage. 
 

  A1-   
 Very minor damage, normally restricted to antenna damage or antennae
attached separately in the envelope. 
 

  A-   
  These specimens have minor damage, such as antenna damage, or minor
flight wear such as small scratches, minor sale damage, some minor
fraying/chipping around the edges of the wings. 
 

  A2:     More
significant damage, such as major flight wear, small rips, small pieces missing
from the wings, damage to the thorax or abdomen. 
 

  B or Second Grade   These

degree. Usually used as parts replacement or art work material

 You will recieve one A1 specimen.   They are packaged as you see here, with the wings already spread out. All you'll need to do is open the package (carefully!) and glue into your project.  Most, if not all insects are hand raised or from sustainable and ethical sources such as insect farms and aviaries. People in third-world countries are able to plant mass crops that are more sustainable and profitable than the natural land. They are given the motivation to maintain insect populations and their habitats. A purchase from my shop helps fight extinction and the destruction of habitats worldwide. We do not stock or encourage the collection of endangered/threatened species. I do my best to purchase my insects from responsible sources, so when you purchase an insect from me, you are also helping to promote insect and native forest conservation!!! :) I am a LICENSED IMPORTER all specimens I carry are NOT endangered AND are absolutely legal to own.","Condition: New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item (including handmade items).

This bat species is a very important pollinator of fruit trees, such as durian, banana, and jackfruit. It roosts in caves, in larger groups, with some roosts exceeding 50,000 individuals, and it sometimes roosts with other bat species. In some places, this species seems to have adapted well to leafy, semi-urban habitats. 
  
 Here it is eternally housed and forever on display in your very own “floating frame“. 
  
 *IMPORTANT* I offer these ""Floating Frames"" as an inexpensive alternative to my hand made shadowboxes and Lucite products. They are constructed entirely of plastic. NOT GLASS. The specimen is housed between two transparent, flexible plastic membranes for a 3D floating effect. 
  
 Comes with a pedestal for stand-up display on a mantle, curiosity cabinet, shelf, your desk at work, coffee table, etc. The frame is easily removed from pedestal and if you would like I will add hardware for hanging on the wall. Let me know in a note at checkout if you would like the hardware added and I will gladly do so at no extra charge. 
  
 Makes an excellent birthday gift, Christmas gift, holiday gift, etc. 
  
 Measures approximately 5” x 5” 
  
 Please note, my pieces are made to order. While everything will be made with the highest of quality standards, exact appearances may differ slightly from pictures. Remember, just like people, no two invertebrates are alike and yours will be unique. Just like you🖤💀 
  
 All of our specimens are hand-raised or from sustainable sources such as butterfly farms, aviaries, and nurseries. These establishments are located on all corners of the globe including Africa, Central and South America, and Southeast Asia, to name a few. Supporting a market for insects as artwork and educational specimens creates jobs in third world countries and an industry that is motivated by maintaining insect populations and their natural habitats, rather than their destruction. Your purchase helps prevent extinction and supports the fight against deforestation and habitat destruction worldwide. 
  
 A portion of all purchases at Morbid Orchid Co is donated to Xerces Society; an international non-profit organization, whose mission it is to protect wildlife through the conservation of invertebrates and their habitats.

 If you are purchasing one of my Victorian displays and are familiar with Antique Victorian displays, you are aware of that they have usually fallen into disarray and disintegrated to the point that they no longer show well. My displays mimic the antique look without everything being washed out and tattered due to extreme age. I keep my displays as economical as possible enabling me to make them a lot more affordable than the true antiques. Every display shows well and is sure to be noticed and commented on! All my displays are hand crafted using only the highest quality of items available and as many natural pieces as possible. Much time and thought are invested into each ONE OF A KIND DISPLAY (unless otherwise noted) as to bring life to the natural beauty of each animal so they may be enjoyed for years to come. Each display is decorated specifically to enhance the beauty of the animal/insect showcased as well as show each in a natural setting. These displays will fascinate as well as inspire wonder in all who view! 
  
 Check us out!  Please check out our other displays, they make wonderful Christmas, Birthday, Anniversary and some even Man Cave displays!   
 There are also many more mostly hand made and unique items!  Please check our feedback for comments on our wonderful and unique items.

  This is a real hanging bat showcased in a Shadowbox floating frame .  This showcases the bat very well and would be a great addition to any collection and look great just sitting on a shelf!   
  
 Framed Display Approx. Dimensions: 9 x 9 x 2"" 
 This is nicely showcased in a shadowbox type frame that suspends him in a clear elasticity film so both sides may be viewed unobstructed and also gives the specimen the illusion of ""floating""! This can be opened but I advise against it as the specimens or the elasticity strip usually are damaged when you open the display. If the film in your display starts to stick together or gets some bubbles in it you can open the case very slowly so the film releases from both side and close again very slowly and the problem should be resolved. If the film gets touched are is in a hot area this can happen but it is a very easy fix also sometimes in shipping the specimen can shift a little in the display. If this happens please contact us and we will direct you on a quick and easy fix. Once the display has been opened returns are no longer accepted.  
 HANGING DISPLAYS:  The floating displays all have removable bases so if you would like, just a piece or two of Velcro or command strip will mount these right to your wall without a problem. The case will keep him clean and safe for years to come!  
  
 Species: Megaderma Spasma 
 The lesser false vampire bat is a bat found in South Asia and Southeast Asia from Sri Lanka and India in the west to Indonesia and the Philippines in the east. They live in caves and tree hollows. They are insectivorous.

 Framed Display Approx. Dimensions: 6.5"" x 6.5"" x 2"" 
  
 This is nicely showcased in a shadowbox type frame that suspends him in a clear elasticity film so both sides may be viewed unobstructed and also gives the specimen the illusion of ""floating""!   This can be opened but I advise against it as the specimens or the elasticity strip usually are damaged when you open the display.  If the film in your display starts to stick together or gets some bubbles in it you can open the case very slowly so the film releases from both side and close again very slowly and the problem should be resolved.  If the film gets touched are is in a hot area this can happen but it is a very easy fix also sometimes in shipping the specimen can shift a little in the display.  If this happens please contact us and we will direct you on a quick and easy fix.   Once the display has been opened returns are no longer accepted.  
 HANGING DISPLAYS:  The floating displays all have removable bases so if you would like,  just a piece or two of Velcro or command strip will mount these right to your wall without a problem. The case will keep him clean and safe for years to come!

It's the typical thing one would find in a cabinet of curiosities.  These bats are from several different groups.  The scientific names are on the labels.  We've printed the labels on 25-year-old paper so they'd have a good vintage base.   The label has been aged and scuffed to further give the appearance of being vintage.  We custom-designed a cork so that it also looks very old and used.  This cork is a natural, one-piece cork, not an agglomerated cork. 
  
 Note that we re-take pictures each time so that you can purchase with confidence that what you are buying is what you are seeing in the photos.  This also means that we will appear to sell out each time one is sold.  We have supply for a few more or so and will take new photos as quickly as possible. 
  
 The dimensions of this display are 
  
 Height (with cork) - approximately 3.5"" to 4.25""  
 Diameter:  - approximately 1.125""

As with all of our tube products, the label is aged --and the cork, too!  This cork is a real, single-piece cork. The aging on it looks really nice.  We added a cork disk to the bottom of the tube so the skeleton has a softer landing if it encounters the bottom of the tube. 
  
 ***NOTE!! Although the little bat can be removed from the tube by pulling its tail, we recommend significant caution if you remove it to ensure it does not break.  Actually, it's probably better to keep it in its tube. We removed it during picture taking so that you can get a better view of it.****

 A beautiful, haunting goth display!  It's a bat skull that has been resin dipped to make it stronger and then beautifully showcased with a preserved dark red rose and black moss in the base of this creepy, gravity defying candle holder! These candle holders are so IN right now and NO ONE will have one like this! The candleholder is 3D printed resin and gives the illusion of candlewax hovering in the air. The moss, rose, and little bat skull are REAL!  It is a very nice looking display and would be a great addition to any collection.  Display itself is approx.  9"" x 3.5"" You'll want to use a battery operated candle in the top as the 3D printed material shouldn't be exposed to the heat of a real candle.

 If you are purchasing one of my Victorian displays and are familiar with Antique Victorian displays, you are aware of that they have usually fallen into disarray and disintegrated to the point that they no longer show well. My displays mimic the antique look without everything being washed out and tattered due to extreme age. I keep my displays as economical as possible enabling me to make them a lot more affordable than the true antiques. Every display shows well and is sure to be noticed and commented on! All my displays are hand crafted using only the highest quality of items available and as many natural pieces as possible. Much time and thought are invested into each ONE OF A KIND DISPLAY (unless otherwise noted) as to bring life to the natural beauty of each animal so they may be enjoyed for years to come. Each display is decorated specifically to enhance the beauty of the animal/insect showcased as well as show each in a natural setting. These displays will fascinate as well as inspire wonder in all who view! 
  
 Check us out!  Please check out our other displays, they make wonderful Christmas, Birthday, Anniversary and some even Man Cave displays!   
 There are also many more mostly hand made and unique items!  Please check our feedback for comments on our wonderful and unique items.

If you have any questions about the fabrics or would like to see more photos, please feel free to reach out to me as I have many photos in my archives.  Each shadowbox is carefully crafted by hand when you place your order.  Because they contain real specimens, no two will ever be exactly the same.  Please keep in mind that my fabric swatches are cut from the bolt at random, so the placement of the pattern may vary slightly from the swatches shown.  Each box comes with antique silver or brass metal corner embellishments (you choose).  If you're unsure of which one to choose, I would be happy to make a selection for you based on what I feel pairs best with your fabric.  I carry several different styles of corners, so while I will try to match what's in the photos, if I am out of stock you will receive a different but similar style.  My shadowboxes are guaranteed to make a wonderful addition to your gothic home decor, or perhaps the perfect gift for the curiosities and oddities collector :) 
  
 Note:  Fabric #3 is hand-dyed and may vary slightly in shade with each batch of dying.  Variation is minimal, but if this is an issue for you, please select one of the other fabrics.

 Where do my bats come from?  
  
 These bats are indigenous to Indonesia and inflict serious damage on many fruit crops. They are so numerous and considered huge pests to fruit farms, so the farmers set up nets around the fruit trees. The bats that die in the nets are given to someone who preserves and cleans them to sell as taxidermy specimens for income, which I in turn repurpose into a beautiful pieces of art for you :) All specimens are legal and come with permits.

 Framed Display Approx. Dimensions: 6.5"" x 6.5"" x 2"" 
  
 This is nicely showcased in a shadowbox type frame that suspends him in a clear elasticity film so both sides may be viewed unobstructed and also gives the specimen the illusion of ""floating""!   This can be opened but I advise against it as the specimens or the elasticity strip usually are damaged when you open the display.  If the film in your display starts to stick together or gets some bubbles in it you can open the case very slowly so the film releases from both side and close again very slowly and the problem should be resolved.  If the film gets touched are is in a hot area this can happen but it is a very easy fix also sometimes in shipping the specimen can shift a little in the display.  If this happens please contact us and we will direct you on a quick and easy fix.   Once the display has been opened returns are no longer accepted.  
 HANGING DISPLAYS:  The floating displays all have removable bases so if you would like,  just a piece or two of Velcro or command strip will mount these right to your wall without a problem. The case will keep him clean and safe for years to come!

This is a very nicely done display and would look in any collection or for educational purposes!  
  
 Framed Display Approx. Dimensions: 7 x 7 3/4 x 1 1/2"" 
  
  
 This is nicely showcased in a shadowbox type frame that suspends him in a clear elasticity film so both sides may be viewed unobstructed and also gives the specimen the illusion of ""floating""!   This can be opened but I advise against it as the specimens or the elasticity strip usually are damaged when you open the display.  If the film in your display starts to stick together or gets some bubbles in it you can open the case very slowly so the film releases from both side and close again very slowly and the problem should be resolved.  If the film gets touched or is in a hot area this can happen but it is a very easy fix also sometimes in shipping the specimen can shift a little in the display.  If this happens please contact us and we will direct you on a quick and easy fix.   Once the display has been opened returns are no longer accepted.  
 HANGING DISPLAYS:  The floating displays all have removable bases so if you would like,  just a piece or two of Velcro or command strip will mount these right to your wall without a problem. The case will keep him clean and safe for years to come!

 Framed Display Approx. Dimensions: 6.5"" x 6.5"" x 2"" 
  
 This is nicely showcased in a shadowbox type frame that suspends him in a clear elasticity film so both sides may be viewed unobstructed and also gives the specimen the illusion of ""floating""!   This can be opened but I advise against it as the specimens or the elasticity strip usually are damaged when you open the display.  If the film in your display starts to stick together or gets some bubbles in it you can open the case very slowly so the film releases from both side and close again very slowly and the problem should be resolved.  If the film gets touched or is in a hot area this can happen but it is a very easy fix also sometimes in shipping the specimen can shift a little in the display.  If this happens please contact us and we will direct you on a quick and easy fix.   Once the display has been opened returns are no longer accepted.  
 HANGING DISPLAYS:  The floating displays all have removable bases so if you would like,  just a piece or two of Velcro or command strip will mount these right to your wall without a problem. The case will keep him clean and safe for years to come!

 Where do my bats come from? These bats are indigenous to Indonesia and inflict serious damage on many fruit crops. They are so numerous and considered huge pests to fruit farms, so the farmers set up nets around the fruit trees to trap them. The bats that die in the nets are given to someone who preserves and cleans them to sell as taxidermy specimens for income, which I in turn repurpose into a beautiful pieces of art for you :) All specimens are legal and come with permits.",,"LIGHT COLOR: Select an option;

 This magnificent antique gold finish taxidermy bat lantern is LARGE, and measures in at around 19.5 inches tall (not including handle).  Inside the lantern is a real taxidermy fruit bat that hangs from a hemp cord.  At the bottom of the lantern is a battery-powered light that not only changes color, but also comes with a remote control! From the palm of your hand you can select any color your heart desires or even set the lights to a color changing pattern. Light is surrounded by artificial blackened moss that can be removed if you prefer it without.  Please note that the size of the bat may vary slightly from piece to piece, depending on what I currently have.

 ★★★ WHERE DO THESE BATS COME FROM? ★★★ 
 Most of my bats are fruit bats that are indigenous to Indonesia. Unfortunately fruit bats inflict serious damage on many fruit crops. They are so numerous and considered huge pests to fruit farms, so the farmers set up nets around the fruit trees. The bats that die in the nets are given to someone who preserves and cleans them to sell as taxidermy specimens for income, which I in turn repurpose into a beautiful pieces of art for you :) All specimens are legal and come with permits. 
  
 ★★★ ATTENTION DOG / CAT OWNERS ★★★ 
 Please be mindful of where you place your lantern if you have dogs or cats SO THEY DON'T EAT THEM.  My dog has gotten ahold of a bat and I've had several customers tell me their pet has as well... so consider yourself warned.

 Where do my bats come from? These bats are indigenous to Indonesia and inflict serious damage on many fruit crops. They are so numerous and considered huge pests to fruit farms, so the farmers set up nets around the fruit trees to trap them.

 Where do my bats come from? These bats are indigenous to Indonesia and inflict serious damage on many fruit crops. They are so numerous and considered huge pests to fruit farms, so the farmers set up nets around the fruit trees to trap them. The bats that die in the nets are given to someone who preserves and cleans them to sell as taxidermy specimens for income, which I in turn repurpose into a beautiful pieces of art for you :) All specimens are legal and come with permits.

 Where do my bats come from? These bats are indigenous to Indonesia and inflict serious damage on many fruit crops. They are so numerous and considered huge pests to fruit farms, so the farmers set up nets around the fruit trees. The bats that die in the nets are given to someone who preserves and cleans them to sell as taxidermy specimens for income, which I in turn repurpose into a beautiful pieces of art for you :) All specimens are legal and come with permits.",,"Backing Fabric: Select an option;

 The painted bat (Kerivoula picta) is a species of vesper bat in the family Vespertilionidae. 
 It is found in Brunei, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam. It is found in arid woodland. 
 The body and tail are the same length. The body length is 3 to 5.5 cm. The tail length is 3 to 5.5 cm as well. The wingspan is 18–30 cm. Weight is about 5g. 
 Small groups of these animals are often found in the most unlikely roosts such as in the suspended nests of weaver finches and sunbirds or under the eaves of huts. Doubtless the bright and broken coloration of these bats is a form of camouflage to protect them while they roost in vulnerable sites. Although nothing is known of their reproductive habits, Painted bats have nuclear family units - that is, a mother, a father, and young. Hunting flights last around 1–2 hours. 
 Besides the coloring it is otherwise a fairly normal microbat that uses sonar to catch insects at night. 
 They live in Southern and eastern India to southern China. They are rare and live in groups of only 2–6. 
 Kerivoula picta is bright orange or scarlet, with black wings and orange along the fingers. As in other species of Kerivoula, K. picta possesses long, wooly, rather curly hair, a small, fragile form, large funnel-shaped ears and 38 teeth. Ears are naked. Tragus is long, narrow, and transparent. Muzzle very hairy. Older males are brighter than females. 
  
 Each framed specimen comes with an information card stating the common name, scientific name, and origin of the insect. The information for this lizard is attached to the back of the frame. 
  
 Framed insects shipped within the 48 Continental United States are always shipped Priority Mail. All my pieces are packaged with great care and LOTS of bubble wrap! I ship internationally!  Buy with confidence! 
  
 I am a biologist and an artist. The natural world has always inspired me. Most people think of insects as creepy and ugly, but I think they are interesting and beautiful. I aspire to present insects as a unique piece of art, which both the collector and novice can appreciate. My hope is that people will be intrigued by my pieces and inspired to learn more about the natural world. Every day is Earth Day!

 The coat of black-bearded tomb bats is quite variable dependent on its particular environment. It ranges from grayish to multi-brown or red variations. Hairs are typically white tipped, turning increasingly more red or brown towards the base. Fur is present on the tail (uropatagium) membrane. No throat sac is present, but a series of pores that open into the throat region is present where the sac would be located. Males have a black beard, which is believed to be seasonal. In the mating season, males produce a thick substance into the beard that is believed to be a form of pheromone to attract mate. The thick tail tapers to a slightly bulbous tip. The wings attach just above the ankles.

 Bats have a deep association with witchcraft. In Magick, properties of a bat include power, control and luck. Ink crafted from the blood of a bat has been used to enhance spells and make pacts with spirits.

 This is a real skeleton of a Short-nosed fruit bat. Just like birds, bat skeletons have light and reduced number of bones compared to the land vertebrate, which allows them to be powerful flyers. Once they find their landing spot they will use their shorter curved thumb to climb or walk on the ground.  
  
 Have you ever wondered why do bats roost upside down? One of the main reasons is to put them in an ideal position for takeoff. Unlike birds, bats can't launch themselves into the air from the ground. Their wings don't produce enough lift to take off from a dead stop, and their hind legs are so small and underdeveloped that they can't run to build up the necessary takeoff speed. Instead, they use their front claws to climb to a high spot and then fall into flight. By sleeping upside down in a high location, they are all set to launch if they need to escape the roost.

 This is a real taxidermy Black Bearded Tomb Bat skeleton, framed nicely in a beautiful gray wood shadowbox. He rests on a dark background to show off his unique shape and would look great in any collection! In all, this display is approximately  8"" x 6"" x 3""- 
  
 Species:  taphozous melanopogon 
 The black-bearded tomb bat is a species of sac-winged bat. It is found in South and South East Asia. 
 In the mating season males produce a thick substance into the beard that is believed to be a pheromone to attract mates. 
 The coat of black-bearded tomb bats is quite variable dependent on its particular environment. It ranges from grayish to multi-brown or red variations. Hairs are typically white tipped, turning increasingly more red or brown towards the base. Fur is present on the tail (uropatagium) membrane. No throat sac is present, but a series of pores that open into the throat region is present where the sac would be located. Males have a black beard, which is believed to be seasonal. In the mating season, males produce a thick substance into the beard that is believed to be a form of pheromone to attract mate. The thick tail tapers to a slightly bulbous tip. The wings attach just above the ankles.

This is a very nicely done display and would look in any collection or for educational purposes!  
  
 Framed Display Approx. Dimensions: 7 3/4 x 7 1/2 x 1 1/2"" 
 This is nicely showcased in a shadowbox type frame that suspends him in a clear elasticity film so both sides may be viewed unobstructed and also gives the specimen the illusion of ""floating""!   This can be opened but I advise against it as the specimens or the elasticity strip usually are damaged when you open the display.  If the film in your display starts to stick together or gets some bubbles in it you can open the case very slowly so the film releases from both side and close again very slowly and the problem should be resolved.  If the film gets touched are is in a hot area this can happen but it is a very easy fix.  Once the display has been opened returns are no longer accepted.  
 HANGING DISPLAYS:  The floating displays all have removable bases so if you would like,  just a piece or two of Velcro or command strip will mount these right to your wall without a problem. The case will keep him clean and safe for years to come!

By creating a market for insects as artwork and educational specimens we are giving them motivation to maintain the insect populations and their natural habitats. Your purchase helps prevent extinction and support the fight against deforestation and habitat destruction worldwide. 
  
  
 If you would like data for the specimen (location of origin and date collected), please let me know and I will be sure to include it for you.

 This listing is for ONE 6x8 taxidermy bat shadowbox  with the fabric of your choosing.  After many years I have finally managed to compile *most* of my fabrics into one listing with the best representation of color and pattern that I can accurately convey.  If you have any questions about the fabrics or would like to see more photos, please feel free to reach out to me as I have many photos in my archives.  Each shadowbox is carefully crafted by hand when you place your order.  Because they contain real specimens, no two will ever be exactly the same.  Please keep in mind that my fabric swatches are cut from the bolt at random, so the placement of the pattern may vary slightly from the swatches shown.  Each box comes with antique silver or brass metal corner embellishments (you choose).  If you're unsure of which one to choose, I would be happy to make a selection for you based on what I feel pairs best with your fabric.  Please note that I carry several styles of corners and the ones I use in your box may be slightly different than what’s shown in the photos if I am out of stock. 
  
 My shadowboxes are guaranteed to make a wonderful addition to your gothic home decor, or perhaps the perfect gift for the curiosities and oddities collector :) 
  
 Note:  This listing is only for the 6x8 shadowbox.  Any other boxes shown are to display fabrics only and can be purchased in separate listings.

 Framed Display Approx. Dimensions: 7 3/4 x 7 1/2 x 1 1/2"" 
 This is nicely showcased in a shadowbox type frame that suspends him in a clear elasticity film so both sides may be viewed unobstructed and also gives the specimen the illusion of ""floating""!   This can be opened but I advise against it as the specimens or the elasticity strip usually are damaged when you open the display.  If the film in your display starts to stick together or gets some bubbles in it you can open the case very slowly so the film releases from both side and close again very slowly and the problem should be resolved.  If the film gets touched are is in a hot area this can happen but it is a very easy fix.  Once the display has been opened returns are no longer accepted.  
 HANGING DISPLAYS:  The floating displays all have removable bases so if you would like,  just a piece or two of Velcro or command strip will mount these right to your wall without a problem. The case will keep him clean and safe for years to come!  
  
 Species Kerivoula Picta 
 The painted bat is a species of vesper bat in the family Vespertilionidae. It is found in Bangladesh, Brunei, Burma, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. It is found in arid woodland and is fairly uncommon but widespread.

Bats are ethically sourced and we utilize a variety of species. Bats are typically 4-6inches large. Please message us if you have a specific size in mind!  
  
 All our lanterns are upcycled and unique. Occasionally we are able to get the same lantern but this is rare.  
  
 To each bat we add ethically sourced moss, stones, crystals and cedar rounds to prevent bug issues. We strongly suggest getting a spray repellent for your bat just to be extra safe, however the cedar round should do this job well on its own. However we suggest the spray treatment atleast 3 times a year.  
  
 We also add battery powered fairy lights. In the personalization section we ask you to list an intention for this familiar so that they may help you in your spell casting. You may also list your color choice for the fairy lights however we do choose these at our discretion based on the lanterns we hand pick for you.  
  
 Lanterns are hand chosen and we do this intuitively. You may not choose your own lantern.  
  
 Upon arrival, we strongly suggest you name your bat and introduce yourself. Remind them of the intention they are to assist with and let your familiar do the rest.  
  
 These are limited availability and each one takes time to create. Due to the unique nature, we do not offer refunds or exchanges. However if an item arrives damage we will solve that on a case by case issue to ensure you receive the highest quality bat.  
  
 ----- 
  
 Remember that clear and focused intention often works best. Don't make a list of your prayers or needs, focus on one that will help you solve the others. Candles are meant to assist, they are not wish granters. As light, they help illuminate the doorways to our manifested desires. 
  
 We have crafted these candles to bring you psychic visions, that is their intended purpose. The herbs and oils chosen reflect that intention.   
  
 These candles often take a little longer to process as the herbs are hand selected for each individual buyer, and are never exactly the same. Other items you may find in your candles are hand chosen stones you can leave in the candle and then keep, shells or charms to assist you in manifesting. Treasure these small wonders and find stillness.  
  
 These candles burn roughly for 7 days if kept with a continuous flame. We urge you not to leave candles unattended.  
 If you cannot properly monitor your candle, extinguish the flame by another element respectfully and light again when you can dedicate your thoughts and focus to your intention. 
  
 Each candle is dressed in herbs and oils according to its intention and then coated with wax to seal in the work. This way as you burn your candle, you release that magic. We strongly suggest putting a petition under your candle with your intention.   
  
 Our candles come in a variety of sizes depending on your needs. The bigger the candle, the more herbs and curios added to it (with appropriate crystals added to most 7 day candles). Photos show the candles with and without the added wax top layer to better show you the ingredients we so delicately selects for each one. If you have questions before purchase, please ask.  
  
 Runes are added to each candle; hand drawn by our witches on the glass of the larger candles or on the bottom of the tea lights. 
  
 Snake and Scorpion can create a custom ritual just for you.  
  
 New to Witchcraft? Have questions? We do online Q and A for an additional fee. We also do Tarot Readings, Energy Work, Reiki, and Aura and Photography Readings and Spell Work for clients. Please email for additional details. 
  
 Confused about the wax reading of your candle or have a bizarre happening during? Be sure to take lots of photos and email us, the witches are happy to do a candle reading for an additional cost to you. 
  
 About Us: 
  
 The Snake and Scorpion hand craft and select all the ingredients for our candles, baths, and more. Our skilled hands select each herb carefully and place it with intention and mastery into every item. The dripping wax we do with whispers of intent and breaths of magic.  
  
 We have curated these items in the veil of incense smoke and the sounds of chants of old.  
  
 Each witch has her skill set, and in tandem you reap the benefits of their decades of skills. The ancestors are called down to channel through us and we then reach out to tie your energy to the universe and send your blessings in the form of candles, mojo bags, and more.

 Framed Display Approx. Dimensions: 9 x 9x 2"" 
 This is nicely showcased in a shadowbox type frame that suspends him in a clear elasticity film so both sides may be viewed unobstructed and also gives the specimen the illusion of ""floating""!   This can be opened but I advise against it as the specimens or the elasticity strip usually are damaged when you open the display.  If the film in your display starts to stick together or gets some bubbles in it you can open the case very slowly so the film releases from both side and close again very slowly and the problem should be resolved.  If the film gets touched are is in a hot area this can happen but it is a very easy fix also sometimes in shipping the specimen can shift a little in the display.  If this happens please contact us and we will direct you on a quick and easy fix.   Once the display has been opened returns are no longer accepted.  
 HANGING DISPLAYS:  The floating displays all have removable bases so if you would like,  just a piece or two of Velcro or command strip will mount these right to your wall without a problem. The case will keep him clean and safe for years to come!

This bat species is a very important pollinator of fruit trees, such as durian, banana, and jackfruit. It roosts in caves, in larger groups, with some roosts exceeding 50,000 individuals, and it sometimes roosts with other bat species. In some places, this species seems to have adapted well to leafy, semi-urban habitats. 
  
 Here it is eternally housed and forever on display in your very own “floating frame“.  
  
 These “Floating Frames” are constructed entirely of plastic. The specimen is housed between two transparent, flexible plastic membranes for a 3D floating effect.  
  
 Comes with a pedestal for stand-up display on a mantle, curiosity cabinet, shelf, your desk at work, coffee table, etc. The frame is easily removed from pedestal and if you would like I will add hardware for hanging on the wall. Let me know in a note at checkout if you would like the hardware added and I will gladly do so at no extra charge. 
  
 Makes an excellent birthday gift, Christmas gift, holiday gift, etc. 
  
 Measures approximately 5” x 5” 
  
 Please note, my pieces are made to order. While everything will be made with the highest of quality standards, exact appearances may differ slightly from pictures. Remember, just like people, no two invertebrates are alike and yours will be unique. Just like you🖤💀 
  
 All of our specimens are hand-raised or from sustainable sources such as butterfly farms, aviaries, and nurseries. These establishments are located on all corners of the globe including Africa, Central and South America, and Southeast Asia, to name a few. Supporting a market for insects as artwork and educational specimens creates jobs in third world countries and an industry that is motivated by maintaining insect populations and their natural habitats, rather than their destruction. Your purchase helps prevent extinction and supports the fight against deforestation and habitat destruction worldwide. 
  
 A portion of all purchases at Morbid Orchid Co is donated to Xerces Society; an international non-profit organization, whose mission it is to protect wildlife through the conservation of invertebrates and their habitats.

 Lesser bamboo bats typically roosts in the slit bored into the shoots of bamboo by leaf beetle larvae. The entrance slit to such cavities is too restrictive for most predators, such as snakes, but the flattened head of the bamboo bat allows it to enter.  
  
 In lesser bamboo bats the sexes display 2 different roosting behaviors. Males are solitary and females are gregarious. In some roosting sites, a single male, twelve adult females and 24 infants were found. Lesser bamboo bats are active at night and roost during the day.

 Framed Display Approx. Dimensions: 6.5"" x 6.5"" x 2"" 
  
 This is nicely showcased in a shadowbox type frame that suspends him in a clear elasticity film so both sides may be viewed unobstructed and also gives the specimen the illusion of ""floating""!   This can be opened but I advise against it as the specimens or the elasticity strip usually are damaged when you open the display.  If the film in your display starts to stick together or gets some bubbles in it you can open the case very slowly so the film releases from both side and close again very slowly and the problem should be resolved.  If the film gets touched are is in a hot area this can happen but it is a very easy fix also sometimes in shipping the specimen can shift a little in the display.  If this happens please contact us and we will direct you on a quick and easy fix.   Once the display has been opened returns are no longer accepted.  
 HANGING DISPLAYS:  The floating displays all have removable bases so if you would like,  just a piece or two of Velcro or command strip will mount these right to your wall without a problem. The case will keep him clean and safe for years to come!

People in third world countries are cutting down the forest to plant mass crops, which are more profitable than what the natural land provides. By creating a market for insects as artwork and educational specimens we are giving them motivation to maintain the insect populations and their natural habitats. Your purchase helps prevent extinction and support the fight against deforestation and habitat destruction worldwide. Please note that the size of the specimen and frame is shown in centimeters via the ruler in the photo of this listing. If you would like more than the quantity available in the listing please message me to let me know as I most likely have additional stock. The front of the frame is glass, the back is solid black, and it comes with a sawtooth hanger so it can be hung on a wall. There is a layer of cotton inside the frame to hold the specimen in place so it will not shift or break during transit. The specimen is not glued in permanently so the frame can be opened and the specimen removed if you wish to reframe, photograph, or use it for some other purpose. There are pins holding the lid to the frame in place. Take the pins out of the sides and carefully lift the lid off to remove the specimen.",,,"TRUE","TRUE","Frame","Entire_bat",,,,,3,58,1,"Entire bat","Frame","Bat","K. picta"
